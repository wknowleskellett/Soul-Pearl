## Setup

Use the releases pane on the right to download the appropriate `.jar` for your Minecraft version. Requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).

## License

I haven't decided yet what license to use. Open an issue if you want to use this code other than to play Minecraft with it, and I'll pick an open source license.
